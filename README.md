## Localization Overview
Belief =Probability  
Sense = product followed by normalization  
Move = Convolution (Addition) 

**Bayes theorem reminder:**  
P(A|B) = P(B|A)*P(A) / P(B)  
 and P(B) = P(B|A)*P(A) + P(B|~A)*P(~A)  
P(A) is prior and P(B|A) is measurement probability  
Theorem of total probability:  
P(B) = Sum P(B/A)*P(A) to normilize the result
